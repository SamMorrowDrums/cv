I was honoured to be invited to demo the GitHub MCP Server at GitHub Universe with Toby Padilla. This was a chance to showcase the work my team has been doing on agent extensibility with a live demonstration of the server in action.

The demo covered setting up Copilot agent mode to interact with GitHub from VS Code, key MCP tools, prompt engineering, and agent-to-agent capabilities that unlock powerful multi-step workflows through natural language.

## The Week Around Universe

Universe was an epic and ridiculously well organised event. There was a huge buzz around MCP and I had a lot of great conversations with developers and builders exploring agent extensibility.

I also attended <a href="https://resources.github.com/mcp-universe-2025/">MCP Universe</a>, a micro summit for agentic builders hosted alongside GitHub Universe. The event brought together open source contributors, startup founders, and enterprise builders to explore MCP and the agentic web. It featured panels with MCP steering committee members from Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI, along with talks from FastMCP author Jeremiah Lowin and other builders in the space. I attended with Carlos Becker, maintainer of the awesome GoReleaser tool.

Later in the week, I attended the Figma MCP Meetup at Figma HQ. It was another great night of MCP discussion with talks from the team who built Figma's MCP server and a chance to connect with VS Code team members and other MCP adopters in person.

## Other Highlights

I took my first Waymo rides around San Francisco, which was an experience in itself.

I also took home a hackable badge from the event after quickly hacking it to show the GitHub MCP Server star count (which has almost hit 25k stars!).
