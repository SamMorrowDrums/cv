I was honoured to be invited to demo the GitHub MCP Server at GitHub Universe with Toby Padilla. This was a chance to showcase the work my team has been doing on agent extensibility with a live demonstration of the server in action.

The demo covered setting up Copilot agent mode to interact with GitHub from VS Code, key MCP tools, prompt engineering, and agent-to-agent capabilities that unlock powerful multi-step workflows through natural language.

## The Week Around Universe

Universe was an epic and ridiculously well organised event. There was a huge buzz around MCP and I had a lot of great conversations with developers and builders exploring agent extensibility.

I also attended <a href="https://resources.github.com/mcp-universe-2025/">MCP Universe</a>, a micro summit for agentic builders hosted alongside GitHub Universe. The event brought together open source contributors, startup founders, and enterprise builders to explore MCP and the agentic web. I attended with Carlos Becker, maintainer of the awesome GoReleaser tool.

The event featured an impressive lineup of speakers including David Soria Parra (Anthropic), Den Delimarsky (Microsoft), and Nick Cooper (OpenAI) from the MCP Steering Committee. We also heard from Jeremiah Lowin (FastMCP, Prefect.io), Shannon Williams (Obot), Toby Padilla (GitHub), Vitaly Gordon (Faros AI), Angie Jones (Block), Matvei Popov (Roboflow), and Cathy Di (Dedalus). The event was moderated by Rob Ferguson (Microsoft for Startups), Kevin Crosby (GitHub), and Simina Pasat (GitHub).

Later in the week, I attended the Figma MCP Meetup at Figma HQ. It was another great night of MCP discussion featuring talks from Jake Albaugh and Aditya Muttur from Figma, Harald Kirschner from Microsoft, Tadas Antanavicius (PulseMCP), and Gagan Bhat from Anthropic. It was a chance to connect with VS Code team members and other MCP adopters in person.

## Other Highlights

I took my first Waymo rides around San Francisco, which was an experience in itself.

I also took home a hackable badge from the event after quickly hacking it to show the GitHub MCP Server star count (which has almost hit 25k stars!).
