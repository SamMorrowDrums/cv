The channel hosts the amazing content from their conference, as well as numerous videos and livestreams on all sorts of MCP and AI related topics.

I'm honoured to be invited to talk about my involvement in building the GitHub MCP Server, there have been so many legends in the field on their channel! I can't wait to share the ideas, problems and dreams we have.
