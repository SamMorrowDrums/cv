> Join us for VS Code Live: Extending Agent Mode, a livestream showing how to unlock the full potential of agent mode using MCP servers and extension tools. We'll kick things off with a look at VS Code's vision in the MCP space, followed by demos from the VS Code team. Plus, we'll spotlight powerful MCP servers and extensions that you can start using in agent mode right away - featuring special guests you won't want to miss!

I had great fun chatting with Olivia Guzzardo McVicker (@OliviaGuzzardo) on the VS Code Livestream on YouTube about the [Remote GitHub MCP Server](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-12-remote-github-mcp-server-is-now-available-in-public-preview/) that launched during the episode! We chat about the server, I demo some functionality live and we also chat about using and extending agents in general.

I hope she'll have me back on again in future to see what we've achieved over the next few months.
