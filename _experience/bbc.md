During my time at the BBC I enjoyed working on a diverse range of projects such as an internal inventory management system, software for quiz shows, rolling out git version management to my team (which was made more difficult by a requirement to use an internal tool hosted on Microsoft IIS servers, which limited options somewhat) and building a web page for the North West 200 motorcycle race.

In delivering these projects I utilised technologies such as NodeJS, Angular, PHP, SQL, python, MongoDB and both internal and various cloud hosting tools.
