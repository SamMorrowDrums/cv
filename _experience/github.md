I am currently working on the Copilot Agent Services team, building agentic AI experiences for GitHub Copilot. In this role, I lead development for the GitHub MCP Server and contribute to the GitHub Coding Agent, focusing on creating intelligent tools that enhance developer productivity through AI-powered automation and seamless integrations.

Previously, I helped to secure the world's code by developing the Code Scanning feature for GitHub, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught prior to merging pull requests. The main languages involved in my role are Golang, Ruby and TypeScript, and I have worked on a wide range of features including public APIs, tooling, internal usage of Codespaces, UI development, and writing ADRs to inform architectural decisions.
