Working at IntelliSense was my first professional introduction to IoT, ML and big data. In my role I worked as a full-stack developer to deliver custom front-end charting and display of data, backend data processing and account management, and some devops for a range of companies (from facilities and chip fabrication to mining and big industry). One of the largest pieces of work I completed was implementing our bare metal Kubernetes solution, enabling us to offer our ML, web, data collection and API tools to both pubic and private cloud hosts with relative ease. 

Processing and managing data at that scale, while delivering real-time insights is certainly challenging, but the team was full of passionate and smart engineers and scientists, and  it taught me a lot about delivering such a large-scale enterprise product - in a market dominated by large incumbents.
