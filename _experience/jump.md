At Jump I work full-stack, primarily on a python Django backend, and React front-end. In my time there I have planned numerous projects and managed other web developers, had deep input into infrastructure decisions, accommodated full re-designs and implemented a huge amount of technical SEO. Building a high-scale, SEO friendly smart job platform has involved numerous technical challenges, but the lean organisational structure, and tight feedback loops have ensured that we always deliver successful features, and we work hard to ensure that outcomes are evaluated with quantitative or qualitative data to verify the success of our work.

As well as working on the web side of things, I have worked substantially with complex SQL analytics queries, and data aggregation and management to ensure that we maximise our use of data from disparate sources and create actionable intelligence to inform our decision-making process. This has enabled people from across all teams to make smart decisions and report on the success of our projects and OKRs.
