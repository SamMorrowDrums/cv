Worked on a prototype game show as the only software developer, building a fully functional interactive gameshow system with a live animated computer game component in every round, building a system to support real-time-communication across multiple machines, with multiple display outputs to provide all the different components:
 
  - Main game screen
  - Buzzer input  
  - Score boards
  - Question and player management
  - Round management
    
I also provided live technical support during major television network pitching sessions, and the prototype was 100% functional. I was able to iterate rapidly when changes were requested during development, and managed to accommodate every different round they wished to experiment with, and I was able to incorporate sound effects and graphics quickly as design iterations occurred. I'd love to share a video of the end result, but alas I'm not currently permitted.
