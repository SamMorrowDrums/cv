The GitHub MCP Server is an open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with the GitHub Platform, enabling AI agents to talk to leverage GitHub and end users to convey their goals and intentions through natural language.

When I started working on this with a couple of colleagues it was a fun side project and it just took off, getting over 10k stars on GitHub in a week and gave it this incredible momentum that lead to thousands of forks of the code and it became my primary focus at work, and a huge part of my team's work.

Leading development of this project involves deeply understanding what makes AI agents better able to leverage tools for both software development tasks and communication/project management. Helping agents to navigate tasks seamlessly is a constant challenge, but there is a tremendous opportunity to continuously make progress on this. Building in this space leads to some very exciting development opportunities, encourages *just crazy enough to work* ideas and offers amazing opportunities fot collaboration with open source contributors to the project.

As MCP was in such an early state at the beginning of the project it has also left so much room to experiment and influence the specification itself.
