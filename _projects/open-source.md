Over the years I have made numerous contributions to open-source projects, and it's something I love to do, and definitely intend to continue! I make a point of trying to help fix issues when encountering bugs or missing features, especially when they impact my day job - rather than only opening issues and expecting others to do the work. I find open source contribution to be some of the most rewarding work I have done. I particularly enjoy seeing issues close that affected many people, as  a result of a feature/fix. I encourage all my employers to allow work time to be spent on open source contributions, as virtually all software companies these days rely on open source dependencies to build their own software.
