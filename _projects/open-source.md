Over the years I have made numerous contributions to open-source projects, and it's something I love to do, and intend to continue! I make a point of trying to help fix issues when encountering bugs or missing features, especially when they impact my day job - rather than only opening issues and expecting others to do the work. I find open source contribution to be some of the most rewarding work I have done, as you see issues close that had many people following, and are now unblocked in whatever use-case they had. I have specific respect for employers that allow work time to be spent on open source contributions, as basically all software companies these days rely on open source dependencies to build their own software.
