Worked on a prototype gameshow as the only software developer, building a fully functional interactive gameshow system with a live animated computer game component, building all the software to support real-time-communication across multiple machines, with multiple display outputs to provide a fully featured platform. I also provided live technical support during major television network pitching sessions.
