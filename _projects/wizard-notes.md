I have a pet project creating a notes / reminder app for inbox zero lovers, which focuses on reducing cognitive load by requiring you to schedule notes to appear later, when you create them, so you only see items when you expect to be able to do something about them - or when you want to think about them.

The project is currently built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) and is targeting the [PinePhone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/), [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) Linux Phones, [ElementaryOS](https://elementary.io/) and other Linux distributions. Once available for the above targets I will be looking into supporting Android/IOS, Mac and Windows.
